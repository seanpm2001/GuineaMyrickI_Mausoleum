## Display screen

### About

The display screen is a crucial component in this modern mausoleum structure, which allows for the viewing of media, slideshows, and more of the deceased. This component can easily be replaced, and is highly customizable, as it doesn't have a hardware requirement other than taking up less than 2 meters (6.5 feet) although you can place the display screen anywhere other than the tomb.

### Recommended specifications

A way for users to navigate the data on the screen (touchscreen recommended, remote, keyboard, and other methods are also allowed)

At least 32/64/128 megabytes of RAM (for modern operating systems, not Windows 10 or MacOS, you would need at least 8196 megabytes (8 GiB) for those systems)

A screen resolution of whatever resolution you want (1920x1080 or higher is recommended)

An operating system that doesn't automatically update/updates don't interrupt the memorial process

Other specs not listed at the moment.
