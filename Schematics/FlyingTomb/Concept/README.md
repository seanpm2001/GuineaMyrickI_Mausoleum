## The flying tomb

The flying mausoleum is a plan to build floating tombs for when there is scarce land for burial on Earth or another orbiting body.

The flying mausoleum has multiples types, all methods are required by ethical codes to be environmentally friendly. This means that coal, oil, gasoline, and the like cannot be used at all. Special uses can be done with charcoal, but not for its burning or extracting, mostly just for filtering.

The first type is just the coffin floating with the display control panel. This should be the average consumer option.

For the residents of the mausoleum, a flying mausoleum is available. Alternatively, it can also land down into water, and be a boating mausoleum.

It is currently unknown how the mausoleums will gain air power, it is an option for the near-distant future.
